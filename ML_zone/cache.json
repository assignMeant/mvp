{"Student ID: 4": [{"id": 1, "question": "Maharishi Kanad postulated that if we keep dividing matter, we will eventually reach the smallest particle that cannot be divided further. What did he name these particles?", "correct_answer": "Parmanu"}, {"id": 2, "question": "In a chemical reaction, 5.3 g of sodium carbonate reacts with 6 g of acetic acid to produce 2.2 g of carbon dioxide, 0.9 g of water, and 8.2 g of sodium acetate. Show that these observations agree with the law of conservation of mass.", "correct_answer": "The total mass of reactants (5.3 g + 6 g = 11.3 g) equals the total mass of products (2.2 g + 0.9 g + 8.2 g = 11.3 g), thus confirming the law of conservation of mass."}, {"id": 3, "question": "In hockey, players often discuss strategies in terms of 'units' or 'lines'. Similarly, in chemistry, what term did Democritus use to describe the smallest indivisible units of matter?", "correct_answer": "Atoms"}]}
